Process [IMDb non-commercial datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).

## Project setup

Standard config files for linting and testing are copied into place from a GitHub repository called
[utility](https://github.com/douglasgreen/utility). See that project's README page for details.

## Scripts

-   `bin/fetch` - Fetch data files and put in `assets/data/` directory.
-   `bin/filter` - Filter the data for recent highly-rated movies.
-   `bin/print_stats` - Print statistics about titles and ratings.

### Using filter

This PHP script, `filter`, allows you to filter the IMDB data sets and find recent highly rated
movies based on various criteria. It provides a convenient way to explore the IMDB data and discover
popular movies that match your preferences.

#### Usage

To use the script, run it from the command line with the desired options:

```
./filter [options]
```

#### Options

The script supports the following options:

-   `-y, --min-year`: Specify the minimum year for the movies. Only movies released on or after this
    year will be included in the results.
-   `-t, --title-type`: Filter movies by title type. Examples of valid title types include
    "tvEpisode" for TV episodes and "movie" for feature films.
-   `-g, --genre`: Filter movies by genre. Examples of valid genres include "Documentary" and
    "Animation".
-   `-r, --min-rating`: Specify the minimum average rating for the movies. Only movies with an
    average rating equal to or higher than this value will be included in the results.
-   `-v, --min-votes`: Specify the minimum number of votes required for a movie to be considered.
    Only movies with a number of votes equal to or greater than this value will be included in the
    results.
-   `-s, --sort-by-votes`: Sort by votes instead of ratings.
-   `-a, --adult`: Include only adult films.

#### Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the script with different options:

1. Find movies released in 2010 or later:

    ```
    ./filter --title-type movie --min-year 2010
    ```

2. Find TV episodes in the "Documentary" genre:

    ```
    ./filter --title-type tvEpisode --genre Documentary
    ```

3. Find movies with an average rating of 8.0 or higher and at least 10,000 votes:

    ```
    ./filter --title-type movie --min-rating 8.0 --min-votes 10000
    ```

4. Find animated movies released in 2015 or later with a minimum rating of 7.5:
    ```
    ./filter --title-type movie --min-year 2015 --genre Animation --min-rating 7.5
    ```

The script will output the filtered results, displaying the movie title, release year, average
rating, and number of votes for each matching movie.

Note: Make sure you have the required IMDB data sets (`title.basics.tsv.gz` and
`title.ratings.tsv.gz`) in the `assets/data` directory before running the script.
